                I’m a retired firefighter of over 30 years of service, worked 24
                hours at the firehouse then 48 hours off, during the 2 days off I
                have done pretty much of everything to a home today. Designed
                & Built two of my own homes. I have done remodeling, installations,
                repairs, upgrades myself over 50 years, including  plumbing,
                electrical, carpentry, etc. I try to do all the work myself. If
                I haven't done it or I can’t do it, I’ll tell you up front.

                I bought an older home and I have been relying on Bob’s expertise
                as I update each room. He is very competent with attention to
                detail in every task. He jumps easily from installing blinds to
                making complicated home repairs.  I would recommend him to handle
                any household project.
